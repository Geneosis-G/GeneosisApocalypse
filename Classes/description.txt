[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]Finally, here we are! That last mod took forever compared to many others... But it was worth spending time in it :p
This mod was in the request thread since the very beginning, because I added it myself after seeing the existing angel and demon goats: I thought some epic battle between those goats would make a fun mod :)
The battle is not as epic as I wanted it, but it is still really fun to watch and be part of. I planned to make a 100 VS 100 fight, but even my computer couldn't handle that, so I ended up with a 25 VS 25 XD
One one side we have the demons, which uses the demon goat horns and the red skin found in the game files (not sure if any other mutator use it). For them, I wanted a really powerful attack, yet something slightly different from what we have seen before. This is how I ended up with the demonic beam: basically a laser with an explosion where it touches. Not that hard to program, and looks really cool, what else to ask for :D
On the other side we have the angels, whick uses the original angel goat skin. The design of their attack took a lot more time, because there is a lot of different visual and physicsl parts to it. First the heaven gate is using the MMO portal model (as it's the most cloud-like effect I could find) and will follow the angel enemy for a short time. Then the holy cross rain is based on improved porcupine spikes: The basic behavior is the same, but they stick fly and stick with a better angle than the spike they come from.
Each camp having their basic fighter, I wanted to add something more to this game mode: a group behavior. I had in mind the pentagram circle for demons, which could be used to turn enemies into more demons, so I tried to think of a counterpart for angels and I ended up with this heaven halo. The circles have almost iddentical behavior for each side: They wait for enough summoners (4) to be near the circle, then they perform the ritual on any eligible NPC in the circle. Originally I wanted to make the demons corrupt angels into more demons, but in order to balance the abilities of each side, I had to make the opposite: the angels will trun demons into more angels.
Then came the rewards for helping each side of this final battle to win! When I added the mod to the list I was thinking about completely different powers, but as many of the powers I had in mind were released in other mods before, I had to find new ones to give them. Giving to each of them the fancy new attack used by their army sounded like a good idea, and I thought about giving them the ability to create ritual circles with the same ability as well, but that sounded a bit too cheap and would also cause problems as it would allow to spawn some demons and angels when the Apocalypse mutator is not active. So I kept the ritual circle skins, but I gave them brand new effects: The circle made by God Goat bring life and peace to the world by reviving any dead creature in it and also making them passive, and the Satan Goat circle bring instantaneous end to any life. Also, I couldn't think of a almighty being not able to move freely in the air, so I gave them a lot of jumps and the usual hover ability.
Finally, we have the Void Goat... As you certainly noticed, this have almost nothing to do with the rest of this mod at all XD This mutator is mainly there because there was a buch of abilities I always wanted to have packed on the same goat in one mutator X) Anyway, I found a nice way (I hope) to bring some science madness in a mod about angels and demons: what can possibly end the universe after killing every single angel, demon, human and goat? Science of course :D Now about the content, the black hole is pretty much the same you can obtain from the Waste of Space mod, but with extended destruction power (works on vehicles and moving objects too). And the worm hole is my humble attempt at producing portal-like behavior in this game ^^ I really didn't want to make portals that you can't see through when I placed the Portal mod in the abandonned list... But I changed my mind and decided that some people will still be happy with teleporters that looks like plain black portals, so here are the worm holes :)[/quote]
